<h1 align="center">Cyclistic Bike-share Analysis</h1>

This [case study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/7PGIT/case-study-1-how-does-a-bike-share-navigate-speedy-success) is the final part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) available on Coursera.

## Company Background

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. It offers bicycles, electric bicycles, and scooters to riders across the city. While many Cyclistic users ride for leisure, approximately 30% use the service to commute to work daily.

Cyclistic provides three pricing plans:
- Single-ride passes
- Full-day passes
- Annual memberships

Riders who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual users, whereas those with annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Recent financial analysis suggests that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. Cyclistic's marketing director sees an opportunity to convert more casual users into members. To do this, the team must better understand how casual riders and members behave differently, what might motivate casual users to become members, and how digital media could shape their strategy.

## Report Overview

The central question is:

> **"How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"**

## Key Objectives
- Show how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
- Analyse average ride durations across user types
- Visualise ride trends by day of week and month
- Understand bike type preferences and usage distribution
- Provide data-driven recommendations to increase membership

## Summary
- Casual riders prefer weekend rides and tend to stay longer on bikes
- Members are more consistent in ride frequency, favouring weekdays
- Hire volumes peak on Saturdays
- Electric bikes are the most popular vehicle type among both groups of users
  
## Recommendations
- Offer weekend trial memberships to entice casual riders into membership
- "Upgrade and save" campaigns timed for Saturday/Sunday usage
- Tailor marketing to show that membership would save money for longer hire length.
