# Cyclistic Bike-share Analysis

This was a Capstone project done as the final part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

The project explores bike-share user patterns for Cyclistic, a fictional company, aiming to understand rider behavior across member and casual groups. Through data wrangling and visualisation, it uncovers insights to support marketing decision-making.
The data used comes from Divvy - a Chicago based bike-share company - whose data is made available by [Motivate International Inc](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
